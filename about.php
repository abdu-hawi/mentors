              Student Mentorship System(My Mentor) is a web-based system that is developed to provide peer mentoring
              that newly admitted students (freshmen), seniors, and universities will benefit from. Mentoring is a
              formal relationship within a time frame between two individuals: mentor and mentee. A mentor, from one
              side, shares expertise, knowledge, or advice in order to support and inspire a mentee academically,
              socially, or emotionally. The mentee, on the other side, usually seeks guidance and additional support to
              achieve his/her goals. Hence, mentees must drive the relationship with the mentor by initiating contact as
              mentorship programs do not typically have scheduled session times (Davis, 2021, p.9). The proposed system
              is designed to create an online peer mentoring environment where students, from a specific university, get
              together and interact with each other virtually. Through the proposed system, Freshmen are linked with
              seniors of their choice to find answers, enhance their academic performance, and learn new skills;
              seniors, on the other hand, are linked with graduates of their choice to build their network, be familiar
              with workplace behaviors and be exposed to new opportunities. Peer mentoring is approved to be a
              successful approach giving many characteristics such as sharing a common perspective between both mentors
              and mentees and the availability of a large number of experienced potential seniors and grads to serve as
              mentors. Such an approach has shown a positive impact on the college studentsâ€™ success such as GPA,
              credits earned, and retention (Colvin & Ashman, 2010). Moreover, universities will benefit from the
              proposed system as it is considered to be less expensive, its students will highly likely stay and
              complete their education, and most importantly will help the university to reach one of the 2030 Saudi
              vision strategic objectives which are reaching one million volunteers
